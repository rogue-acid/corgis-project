	<h1>Information about the earthquake data</h1>
	
	<p class="text">  The data used in this website is from this <a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/json/earthquakes/">Data set</a>. This data set contatins earthquake records from around the world collected from the United States Geological Survey. This includes data such as distance, gap, magnitude, depth and significance are included to properly describe the earthquake. Also data about exact geological coordinates and a relative description of the earthquake’s location is included. The data is from the 27th of July 2016 to the 25th of august 2016. One of the values, significance is important because it shows how much the earthquake effected people and how many it affected. Another important value is magnitude, "Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the size of an earthquake at its source. It is a logarithmic measure. At the same distance from the earthquake, the amplitude of the seismic waves from which the magnitude is determined are approximately 10 times as large during a magnitude 5 earthquake as during a magnitude 4 earthquake. The total amount of energy released by the earthquake usually goes up by a larger factor; for many commonly used magnitude types, the total energy of an average earthquake goes up by a factor of approximately 32 for each unit increase in magnitude. Typically ranges from -1 (very tiny) to 10 (incredibly powerful)." <a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/json/earthquakes/">Source</a>
